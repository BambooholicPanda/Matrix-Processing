# Bootcamp Final Project 1: Matrix processing in Python 🐍
### Processing + recalculating matrix values in relation to those on their 4 sides

This program is the final project for the first module at Keepcoding's IT Bootcamp. We were required to create a function that processes a matrix. The function returns a new matrix in which each value is calculated by doing a summation of the original value and the values on the four sides of it.

In addition, I have included some extra functions that were not required for the project, but I thought that they would make the program much more complete.
These functions generate a matrix with random values, generate a matrix with the operations that take place when processing a matrix and display any matrix to console.
I have also defined a display function that displays a matrix as a pandas data frame, to take in practice what I learnt in Le Wagon webinar.
